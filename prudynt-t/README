Add control to WebUI for to extend low light range.
  - manual exposure 
  - analog gain 
  - set in config-streamer.cgi/Image correction
Integrate GPIO control into Prudynt
  - sensor switch.
  - IR/white lights
  - IR cut
  - add ctrl-hal.cpp/ctrl-hal.hpp
Add Tiled/Map multi-ROIs to motion control. 
  - box mode for one ROI region or,
  - map mode for 8x6 tiles, 48 ROIs
Add auto tracking to PTZ camera
  - use multi-ROIs map mode for tracking.
  - caculate hot spot to track to.
  - avoid false movement by ignore large area hit.
  - auto home at end
Add turn on white light when motion is detected and auto back to previous state after post_time.
Integrate Motor control to interface with motor-daemon for faster response.
  - add Motor.cpp/Motor.hpp
Add dual-sensor/dual-stream (time-shared) RTSP/JPEG streaming at front end and muli-view to WebUI. (platform dependent)
  - Sensors is switched at MIPI interface (use GPIO control) but streams switched at front end after encoders.
  - VideoWorker with 4 streams, 2 encoders.  Use intermediate frame buffers.
  - JPEGWorker with 4 streams, 2 encoders.
  - 4 RTSP stream (ch 0/1/4/5) and 2 onVif profiles 
  - When dual stream is enabled the motion detection will be disabled.
  - Auto frame delay padding to keep sensor and stream in sync.  (will take few switching cycles to sync)
